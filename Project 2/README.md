## Description
This app is based on two activities to interact with the application. On launch, the user will
be greeted with four different food and some of their details. When the user clicks on any
of the food images, they will be directed to a second activity which shows the full details of
each individual food. This app seeks to achieve multi-activity, data sharing using intents,
and using resources and images.
