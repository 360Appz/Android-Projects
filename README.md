## Project 1
## Description
This app consists of three buttons. The buttons are sneeze, blow nose, and take
medication. The initial health is set at 10. The sneeze button reduces the health by 1, take
medication increments by 2, and blow nose plays a sound. The range of the health is kept
between 1 and 10. This task aims to teach how to use lifecycle states, basic decision
making, basic UI design, string externalization, and using Media Player functions for
sound.
