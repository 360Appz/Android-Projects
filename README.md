* ## Project 1
* ### Description
    This app consists of three buttons. The buttons are sneeze, blow nose, and take
    medication. The initial health is set at 10. The sneeze button reduces the health by 1, take
    medication increments by 2, and blow nose plays a sound. The range of the health is kept
    between 1 and 10. This task aims to teach how to use lifecycle states, basic decision
    making, basic UI design, string externalization, and using Media Player functions for
    sound.

* ## Project 2
* ### Description
      This app is based on two activities to interact with the application. On launch, the user will
      be greeted with four different food and some of their details. When the user clicks on any
      of the food images, they will be directed to a second activity which shows the full details of
      each individual food. This app seeks to achieve multi-activity, data sharing using intents,
      and using resources and images.
